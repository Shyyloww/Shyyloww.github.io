                <h3>Legality & Ethics</h3>
                <button class="faq-accordion">What kind of permission is required to use Tether C2?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>You MUST obtain <strong>explicit consent</strong> from the legal owner of any and all computer systems before deploying the Tether C2 agent. This is a non-negotiable condition of use. Believing you have permission is not sufficient. Failure to obtain proper consent is illegal and a direct violation of our Terms of Service, for which you are solely responsible.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="faq-accordion">Is Tether C2 legal to own and use in the United States?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>Owning the Tether C2 software is legal. However, its use is legal **ONLY** under the strict conditions outlined in our <a href="tos.html">Terms of Service</a>. It is designed and intended for use by IT professionals and security researchers for legitimate purposes on systems where they have explicit consent to do so. Using this tool on any computer or network without the owner's explicit consent is illegal under laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and is strictly forbidden.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="faq-accordion">What is your policy on misuse of the software?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>We have a zero-tolerance policy for any use of our software that violates our Acceptable Use Policy. Any account found to be using our software for unauthorized access or any other illegal activity will be permanently banned without a refund. We cooperate fully with legally-binding requests from law enforcement agencies. As stated in our TOS, you are 100% legally and financially responsible for your actions.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Payments & Tiers</h3>
                <button class="faq-accordion">Is this a one-time purchase or a subscription?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>All tiers are a **one-time purchase**. You pay once and receive perpetual access to the features of that tier as they exist at the time of your purchase, plus any future updates made to that tier.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="faq-accordion">What is your refund policy?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>We offer a full refund for up to 30 minutes after the initial purchase. After this window, all sales are final. We provide detailed information on all tiers so you can make an informed decision before buying.</p>

                <h3>Technical Questions</h3>
                <button class="faq-accordion">Will this be detected by antivirus (AV/EDR) software?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>We build our agents with multiple layers of obfuscation and stealth techniques to minimize detection during professional security engagements. However, the security landscape is constantly evolving. No tool can guarantee 100% undetectability. We actively update our methods to stay ahead of modern security solutions as part of our service.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="faq-accordion">What operating systems are supported?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>Currently, the Tether C2 agent is designed for modern versions of the Windows operating system (Windows 10 and Windows 11). The C2 control panel itself is a desktop application that is compatible with Windows.</p>
                </div>
                 <button class="faq-accordion">Do I need my own server or VPN?</button>
                <div class="faq-panel">
                    <p>No. Tether C2 is a fully managed solution. All communications between your control panel and the deployed agent are automatically routed through our secure and encrypted network tunnel. This is included with your purchase.</p>
